Too begin the video i show the home screen of my repo to demonstrate that my README has been documented.
Next, i show my commits and display the network chart of the three respective branches.
I open my main branch in vscode, run the program, and pause for a second to show the ouputs. The outputs show the tests ive written which checks to see that two positives subtract correctly, two negatives subtract correctly and, one positive and one negtaive subtract correctly
i add a simple comment to my code and show me commiting and pushing it to get hub.
Finally, i go to github and show that my new comment was succesfully commitesd.
